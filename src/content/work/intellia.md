I spent three and a half years at <a href="https://www.intelliatx.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Intellia Therapeutics</a>, a company developing therapies for genetic diseases with CRISPR gene editing.

I joined Intellia as a Software Engineer II. I started off by building integrations with lab equipment like liquid handlers and freezers. I used the Python FastAPI framework for back-end APIs (application programming interfaces) and Vue.js for front-end applications. I quickly began contributing to the software platform more broadly, introducing GitHub Actions for CI/CD, standardizing application architectures, and contributing to related open source projects in my free time. For example, I started an open source [project](/projects) called inboard that provides Docker container images for Python web servers. The project has gotten positive feedback from the open source community and the Docker images have been pulled over a million times. I was promoted to Software Engineer III, and then to Senior Software Engineer.

After I was promoted to Senior Software Engineer, my role enabled me to bridge software engineering, computational sciences, and IT to improve the company's cloud infrastructure. One such cross-functional project I led was rebuilding our AWS authentication system to use SSO (single sign-on) with Okta. This project eliminated many security issues and enabled us to use unified user identities for all AWS access. In addition to leading the implementation, I also drove adoption of this new system by providing workshops and technical support.

When we weren't writing code, we found time to hang out and have fun. My movie knowledge helped me become a two-time trivia champion.
